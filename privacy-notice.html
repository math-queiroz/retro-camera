parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the
use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The
inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or
application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the
safety and privacy of data you provide to any third-party websites. Any
data collected by third parties is not covered by this Privacy Notice.

and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services,

tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising,
including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor

parties and service providers use their technology to provide
advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which

YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

required by law.</p>
<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a
longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>

organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the

secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
information, transmission of personal information to and from our

request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to
request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of
your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and
(v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. If a decision that

a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may
also have the right to object to the processing of your personal
information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the

processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will
it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in

email us at <a href="mailto:retrocameraapp@proton.me" class="email">retrocameraapp@proton.me</a>.</p>

DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can
activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
<h2 id="do-we-make-updates-to-this-notice">11. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO
THIS NOTICE?</h2>
